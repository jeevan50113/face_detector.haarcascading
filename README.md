#how this project works
This  project based on opencv and it will detect the human face in real time using python and a bit ML(machime learning).
The data is trained using Haar Cascade which is a machine learning object detection algorithm .basically the image is converted to gray color(black and white) and by using the haar cascade features the algorithum detect the face  


#install the following modules:
1 pip install opencv
2 pip install numpy(exceptional)

#Execution
execute the project in our IDE
